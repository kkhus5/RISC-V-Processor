* Calibre Usage Instructions
*-----------------------------

The Calibre tool environment is available through the Virtuoso toolbar. The
DRC, LVS, and PEX runsets have been supplied with the PDK. 

User is advised to create directories named drc, lvs, and pex in their
local PDK run directory to which they may direct the files generated when
running Calibre DRC, LVS, and PEX, respectively, in order to help reduce
cluttering.

Rule files specific to DRC, LVS, and PEX are required to run the respective
tools and may be found at:

** For DRC:
   $PDK_DIR/calibre/ruledirs/drc/drcRules_calibre_asap7.rul 

** For LVS:
   $PDK_DIR/calibre/ruledirs/lvs/lvsRules_calibre_asap7.rul 

** For PEX:
   $PDK_DIR/calibre/ruledirs/rcx/rcxControl_calibre_asap7.rul 

Specify the above path in the 'DRC/LVS/PEX Rules File' field in the 'Rules'
tab for the corresponding tools. Within the same tab, specify paths to the
drc, lvs, and pex run directories, that were created earlier, in the
'DRC/LVS/PEX Run Directory' field. 

Settings from a particular DRC/LVS/PEX run may be saved as runsets for
later use. Sample runsets are also provided below. However, users are advised
to create their own according to their need. 

** Sample DRC runset:
   $PDK_DIR/calibre/rundirs/drc/runset_dir_drc/drcRunset_asap7

** Sample LVS runset:
   $PDK_DIR/calibre/rundirs/lvs/runset_dir_lvs/lvsRunset_asap7

** Sample PEX runset:
   $PDK_DIR/calibre/rundirs/pex/runset_dir_pex/pexRunset_asap7

User will need to load the runset the very first time during the
start-up. On subsequent invocation, the user will be presented with a
runset used previously.
